# ðŸ“¦ contracts

### Apps and Packages

- `test`: contract instance integration tests
- `contracts`: client contract core instances
- `utils`: utils function methods

### NOTE:

I recommend the following extension to make it easy to switch among packages in your mono repo, as well as open multiple under a single workspace. It makes mono repos work well with the test explorer extension.
