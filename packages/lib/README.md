# ðŸ“¦ @sdk/contract

@sdk/contract is designed to provide a basic framework for creating a client contract. It includes sample code for defining the core instances of a client contract, as well as a basic contract template that can be customized to meet specific needs.

### Apps and Packages

- `test`: contract instance integration tests
- `contracts`: client contract core instances
- `config`: configuration for contract parameters


### NOTE: 
I recommend the following extension to make it easy to switch among packages in your mono repo, as well as open multiple under a single workspace. It makes mono repos work well with the test explorer extension.
